[Guard] (to the King) That’s impossible, nobody can guess someone else’s dream!

[Ashpenaz] (to the audience) Oh no, we’re doomed!! (to Daniel) Daniel, what do we do?

[Daniel] (to Ashpenaz) When you need help, God is with you! (to the audience) My friends (gestures to the audience), we’re going to teach you something very important. It’s called prayer, where we talk to the one true God. And God listens and helps us. (kneels down to pray) My friends, let’s all bow our heads and pray. God, we know you’re with us all the time. We know you help us. Please help us with the difficulties we’re facing right now.  Thank you, God, for being with us and helping us. In your name we pray, Amen.
