(King) (carrying Mic) and Guard (behind the King and carrying charcoal) enter the stage from the left side.

(Daniel’s Friends) (Shadrach carrying Mic) enter the stage from the right side
(Ashpenaz) (behind Daniel’s friends) enter the stage from the right side

[King] (to the audience) I hereby make a new proclamation! (dabs) People of all nations must bow to this statue (points to the statue) when they hear the musicians play.
[King] And anyone who doesn’t bow will be thrown into a blazing furnace!

[Shadrach] King Nebuchadnezzar, we cannot bow down to your statue. We only bow down to the one true God. (passes Mic to Meshach)

[King] Then I’ll have to make the guard throw you into the furnace!

[Meshach] If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to deliver us from it. We want you to know,
[Meshach] Your Majesty, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up.  (passes Mic to Abednego)

[Abednego] Yeah! What he said. (dabs)

[King] Hey, only I can dab. Guard, make the fire seven times hotter!!!

(Guard) throws charcoal to the furnace

(Guard) takes Daniel’s friends (and Mic from Abednego) next to the cardboard fire

(Daniel) enters the stage from the right side and stands next to Ashpenaz

[Daniel] (to Ashpenaz) I just got here! What on earth is happening?

[Ashpenaz] The King is about to throw your friends into a blazing furnace! They’re going to die because they refuse to serve the King’s gods and worship his statue!

[Guard] This is so hot! (passes Mic to Shadrach)

(Guard) pushes Daniel’s Friends behind the cardboard fire.
(Daniel’s Friends) fall and scream.
(Guard) also falls himself.

[Daniel] (looking in the direction of the friends) Oh, what an awful way to die! I can’t watch! (puts his hands over his eyes) (turns to the audience)
[Daniel] My friends must be so afraid. Terrified, in fact! But they didn’t let their fear stop them from following the one true God.
[Daniel] Remember, when you’re afraid, God is with you. He’ll give you the courage you need.

(Daniel’s Friends) (but not the Guard) stand back up and look surprised at themselves seeing that they’re fine. Happily walking around

(Ashpenaz) taps Daniel on the shoulder.

[Ashpenaz] Daniel, Daniel, look!

[Daniel] (puts his hands over his eyes) Oh no I can’t look!

[Ashpenaz] No you don’t understand, your friends are alive! Not even a hair on their heads was burned!

[Daniel] (looks in the direction of friends) Where? Where? Yes! I see them! (moves around the stage in excitement) They’re alive!
[Daniel]  God saved them! That’s what the one true God can do, Ashpenaz!

[King] (to Daniel’s friends) Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out, and come here!
[King] Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who has sent his angel and rescued his servants!

[Ashpenaz] (looking confused as he walks off the stage on the right side) You know, I might have to give a little more thought to that God of yours…

[Daniel] (to the audience) I hope Ashpenaz does come to know our one true God.

(Daniel) leaves the stage on the right side.

(King) leaves the stage on the left side.

(Daniel’s friends and Guard) (carrying the statue and cardboard fire) leave the stage on the left side
